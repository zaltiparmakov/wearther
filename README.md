# What To Wear - Progressive Web App

What to Wear is a web application, based on third-party data, which helps people decide how to
dress, depending on the weather conditions.
The goal is to develop a web application which will inform the user of the application how he/she
should be dressed, depending on the weather condition just for two days (today and tomorrow).
Also, there will be temperature, together with the weather icon. It will have multiple illustration
characters, depending on how old is the user, and gender.
